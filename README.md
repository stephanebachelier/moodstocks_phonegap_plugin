# Moodstocks Phonegap plugin

Phonegap plugin for Moodstocks API 

This works is not available yet. Hard working on it!

## Note

### Adding libmoodstocks-sdk.a automatically is not working 

Copying file with ```cordova``` cli is not fully work. Adding a static lib as a framework will add an entry into the framework list but Xcode will says that it does not found the correct path. Need to investigate further to see if it is possible

### Check license if redistribution is permitted

Don't know for now. 
SDK is available only after registration od developper.moodstocks.com.
